### Hi there, I'm Addi (she/her 💅🏻) 👋🏻


My main interest is in game development 🎮

  - Operating Systems Programming (Working with the linux kernel directly)
  - Assembly Programming
  - Data Structures & Algorithms
  - Network Security/Vulnerability Assessment (Nmap, Nessus, etc.)
  - Cyber Crime in Society

- Programming Languages & Tools:
  - Java with Gradle
  - C/C++ with Cmake
  - Python

 #### Outside of Coding
 
 Aside from coding, I enjoy playing video games, watching livestreams, etc.. Often I'm doing a mix of more than one of these things to keep my brain occupied 🙂 
 
 I have varying interests, they come and go but those are the few that are pretty consistent!
 
 #### Opportunities
 
 I am open to all opportunities that come my way granted I'm a good fit or have interest in the project/company.  
 
 This includes internships, contract work, freelancing, part-time and full-time offers.
 
 Additionally, I'm more than willing to relocate within the US or elsewhere in the world.  I'm most interested in residing in New Zealand, Australia, or a European country.
