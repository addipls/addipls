### Hi there, I'm Addi (she/her 💅🏻) 👋🏻


My main interest is in game development 🎮

Though I really enjoy working with data and making sense of it.  A dream project for me would probably be creating an anticheat for a game, but first I'd like to make my own FPS game!

  - Distributed Systems
  - Game Development
  - Systems Modeling
  
- Some skills/topics I have already learned about:
  - Object Oriented Programming
  - Functional Programming
  - Networking
  - Threading
  - Operating Systems Programming (Working with the linux kernel directly)
  - Assembly Programming
  - Data Structures & Algorithms
  - Network Security/Vulnerability Assessment (Nmap, Nessus, etc.)
  - Cyber Crime in Society

- Programming Languages & Tools:
  - Java with Gradle
  - C/C++ with Cmake
  - Python
  - Basic HTML & CSS
  
 For anyone looking to collaborate, please send me a follow request on Twitter for now [here](http://twitter.com/addis0npls)
 
 #### Opportunities
 
 I am open to all opportunities that come my way granted I'm a good fit or have interest in the project/company.  
 
 This includes internships, contract work, freelancing, part-time and full-time offers.
