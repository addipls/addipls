### Hi there, I'm Addi üëãüèª

My main interests surround security in various forms: writing secure code, game anticheats, and encryption for example.

- Programming Languages & Tools:
  - Java using Gradle, JDBC, JavaFX, JUnit and more
  - Embedded C targeting an Atmega328p
  - Flutter / Dart using Firebase
  - JavaScript using React Native and Redux
  - Basic HTML & CSS
  - Git/Github
  - Linux/Unix 

- I'm currently learning:
  - Code Security
  - Rust with Yew.rs (React-like framework) and Tauri
  - C# with .NET and MAUI
  
- Some skills/topics I have already learned about:
  - Asynchronous programming
  - Object Oriented Programming
  - Functional Programming
  - Networking
  - Threading
  - Distributed Systems
  - Systems Modeling
  - Operating Systems Programming (Working with the linux kernel directly)
  - Assembly Programming
  - Data Structures & Algorithms
  - Network Security/Vulnerability Assessment (Nmap, Nessus, etc.)
  - Cyber Crime in Society

 #### Outside of Coding
 
 Aside from coding, I enjoy playing video games, watching livestreams, etc.. Often I'm doing a mix of more than one of these things to keep my brain occupied üôÇ 
 
 I have varying interests, they come and go but those are the few that are pretty consistent!
 
 #### Opportunities
 
 I am open to all opportunities that come my way granted I'm a good fit or have interest in the project/company.  
 
 This includes internships, contract work, freelancing, part-time and full-time offers.
 
 Additionally, I'm more than willing to relocate within the US or elsewhere in the world.  I'm most interested in residing in New Zealand, Australia, Netherlands, or another European country.
