### Hi there, I'm Addi 👋🏻


My main interest is in game development 🎮

Though I really enjoy working with data and making sense of it.  A dream project for me would probably be creating an anticheat for a game, but first I'd like to make my own FPS game!  

- I'm currently learning:
  - React Native with JavaScript
  - Flutter with Dart
  - Code Security
  - Asynchronous Programming
  
- Some skills/topics I have already learned about:
  - Object Oriented Programming
  - Functional Programming
  - Networking
  - Threading
  - Distributed Systems
  - Systems Modeling
  - Operating Systems Programming (Working with the linux kernel directly)
  - Assembly Programming
  - Data Structures & Algorithms
  - Network Security/Vulnerability Assessment (Nmap, Nessus, etc.)
  - Cyber Crime in Society

- Programming Languages & Tools:
  - Java with Gradle
  - C/C++ with Cmake
  - Python
  - Basic HTML & CSS
  - Git/Github
  - Linux 
 
 #### Outside of Coding
 
 Aside from coding, I enjoy playing video games, watching livestreams, etc.. Often I'm doing a mix of more than one of these things to keep my brain occupied 🙂 
 
 I have varying interests, they come and go but those are the few that are pretty consistent!
 
 #### Opportunities
 
 I am open to all opportunities that come my way granted I'm a good fit or have interest in the project/company.  
 
 This includes internships, contract work, freelancing, part-time and full-time offers.
 
 Additionally, I'm more than willing to relocate within the US or elsewhere in the world.  I'm most interested in residing in New Zealand, Australia, Netherlands, or another European country.
