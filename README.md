### Hi there, I'm Addi (she/her 💅🏻) 👋🏻


My main interest is in game development 🎮

Though I really enjoy working with data and making sense of it.  A dream project for me would probably be creating an anticheat for a game, but first I'd like to make my own FPS game!  

- I'm currently learning:
  - Distributed Systems
  - Game Development
  - Systems Modeling
  
- Some skills/topics I have already learned about:
  - Object Oriented Programming
  - Functional Programming
  - Networking
  - Threading
  - Data Structures & Algorithms
  - Network Security/Vulnerability Assessment (Nmap, Nessus, etc.)
  - Cyber Crime in Society
